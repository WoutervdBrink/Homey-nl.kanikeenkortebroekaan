# Can I wear shorts today?

This app queries the website http://kanikeenkortebroekaan.nl/ to find out if
the weather allows shorts. It features a speech command to ask Homey whether or
not you should wear shorts today, and a screensaver, which turns the Homey green
or red, depending on if the weather does or doesn't allow shorts, respectively.
